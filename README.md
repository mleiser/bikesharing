## Overview of the Analysis
  
### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create a visualization analysis of bike trips. This was done to convince investors that setting up the Citibike bike sharing system in Des Moines is a good investment opportunity. I used Tableau to achieve the visualizations and to create the story. 

## Bikesharing Analysis Results

This graph shows that the vast majority of bikesharing checkouts occur for 5-10 minute intervals with the most amount of bikes checked out only for 5 minutes.

Similarly to the above 2 graphs, this next graph combines the 2 points of data and shows that the majority of renters are male with all genders showing the highest peaks at the 5-10 minute marks.

## Bikesharing Analysis Summary
In summary, the majority of people renting out bikes from bikesharing are male subscribers on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The most used time of day for bike renting is also around 4-5 for around 5-10 minute intervals. Another visualization I would do with the data is a graph that showed the most popular starting and ending station by ID. I would also create a graph that showed the trip duration averages by starting station ID.
